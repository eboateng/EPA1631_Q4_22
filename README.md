# Repository for Group 5
## EPA-simmodel

This repository contains the pooled notebooks from all members of group 5 as well as the report for Model-Based Decision Making in Q4 '22.

Each notebook is named correponding to the method utilized. Each notebook was run seperately and saved figures as well as results folders were augmented 
to create an organized structure after collating all member notebooks. Although checks were done, notebooks cells with editted folders for 
figures were not run thereafter to avoid possible compatibility issues and utilized methods.

All import dependencies are included in the notebooks and can be run sperately as such.

Notebooks are adequately annotated/commented.

Some datasets from results are saved in the 'results' folder.
